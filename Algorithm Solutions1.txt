Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Start.
Step 2: input n;
Step 3: sum=0;
step 3: for i in 1 to n+1:
step 4: sum = sum+i;
Step 5: print sum
Step 6: Stop

Problem 2: Check for Prime Number

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.

The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: input n;
Step 3: for i in 2 to n-1:
Step 4: if n%i == 0;
Step 5: print not a prime;
Step 6: else: print prime;
Step 7 : Stop


Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers

Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.

The user should input three values: a, b, and c.
The algorithm should compare the numbers and print the maximum value.

Algorithm:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: input a,b,c;
Step 3: if a>b and a>c
Step 4: print a is largest
Step 5: else if b>a and b>c then
Step 6: print b is largest
Step 7: else print c is largest
Step 8: Stop

Problem 4: Factorial Calculation

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

The user should input a number n.
The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to n.

Algorithm

Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : input n
Step 3: tot = 1;
Step 4: for i in 1 to n:
Step 5: tot = tot*i;
Step 6: print tot;
Step 7: Stop

Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether n is divisible by 2 and display the result as either "Even" or "Odd".

Algorithm:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: input n
Step 3: if n%2 == 0
Step 4: then print n is even
Step 5: else: print n is odd
Step 6: Stop
